Axon-Syntax-Vim

Contains Vim syntax files for SkySpark's Axon scripting language.  This is implemented through the .trio file extension.  In some cases, .trio files use slightly different rules than normal Axon through the Func app in Skyspark (e.g. no multi-line comments).  In those cases, the syntax highlighting is provided, but is commented out so the .trio rules are followed by default.

To install, copy the files to your .vim/ directory.
